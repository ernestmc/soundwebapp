Useful notes to myself while learning web develoment with Meteor:

Inserting into a collection
Collection_name.insert(object)
We can assign any properties to the task object, such as the time created, since we don't ever have to define a schema for the collection.
Being able to insert anything into the database from the client isn't very secure.

Sound with meteor:
https://github.com/brentjanderson/meteor-buzz
meteor add brentjanderson:buzz

public files go in the "public" directory.

to modify the database globally I will need to write a method that runs on the server side.

By default, every newly created Meteor app contains the autopublish package, which automatically publishes all available documents to every client. To exercise finer-grained control over what documents different clients receive, first remove autopublish, in your terminal:
meteor remove autopublish

Note: testing on Android the sound played when called from a local click event, but not when it's called from the db.change event. Tested on Android 2.3.5 and 5.1.1.

To add boostrap package (new one):
meteor add twbs:bootstrap
